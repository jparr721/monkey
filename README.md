Commercial password managers are a joke. The fact that anyone has to pay to have a single password is nauseating. I know that it's a valid business model, but screw that. This is free, and can be deployed anywhere. Pretty badass IMO.

## Getting Started
First things first, this tool requires openssl to be installed on your computer.

```sh
# macOS
$ brew install openssl@1.1

# Arch Linux
$ sudo pacman -S pkg-config openssl

# Debian and Ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev

# Fedora
$ sudo dnf install pkg-config openssl-devel
```
